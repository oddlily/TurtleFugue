Installation:

  - Install python2.4 or python2.5 (haven't tried 2.3) and the
    developer headers (if you don't do this you will get errors about no
    Python.h found). This is usually easiest as a package, for instance
    'apt-get install python2.5-dev' for debian, but otherwise:
         http://python.org
    If you're building from source make sure you configure with
         ./configure --enable-shared

  - NEW: you can skip the next two steps just by checking out the already
    patched source code anonymously with:
      svn co svn://sizer99.com/tf-50b8-py

  - If you didn't do the svn checkout:
    Get the TinyFugue 5.08b source from http://tinyfugue.sourceforge.net/

    You need the zip version, which has everything in it. The .tar.gz versions
    are missing some files necessary to build the help.
       # unzip -a tf-50b8.zip
       # rm tf-50b8/help/html2tf
    (the .zip version comes with a prebuilt html2tf which will core dump on
    many systems, so this will cause it to be rebuilt)

  - If you didn't do the svn checkout:
    Test the patch, then apply it:
      # cd tf-508b
      # patch -p 1 -u -N --dry-run < tf-python-patch
      # patch -p 1 -u -N < tf-python-patch

  - Run configure, which now has --enable-python by default. Add any extra
    options you want, if any (usually not). IF YOU ALREADY RAN CONFIGURE
    before you applied the patch, that's okay, but you must do it again.
      # ./configure

  - Compile
      # make
    Don't worry about warnings about HAVE_INET_PTON or _POSIX_C_SOURCE.

  - Install
      # make install


Usage:

   - run TinyFugue (tf) and then
       /help tf python

   - Check out tf-lib/urlwatch.py for a simple scripting example. This uses
     only a tiny fraction of what you can do, but I've been so busy making
     this patch I haven't had time to write all the scripts I want!
